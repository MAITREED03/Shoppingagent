In this project, an AI Application with Multi-Agent workflows for Content Writing has been built in Python with Phidata, 
SerpApiTools, Crawl4aiTools and Deepseek-r1 LLM. For building app, streamlit library is used in python.
SerpApiTools is used for Google Search and Crawl4aiTools is used for web crawling/web scrapping.
There are 3 AI agents in this Multi-agent AI system and they are 
specialized in their tasks/roles. They are given below:
1. Content Planner: An expert Content Planner whose job is to plan the content on the given topic
2. Content Writer: An expert Content Writer whose job is to write the insightful and factually accurate content based on the outline and information 
   given by Content Planner
3. Editor: An expert Content Editor whose job is edit the blog post written by the Content Writer

These 3 AI agents will closely work with each other as a Team and then finally an insightful, engaging and structured blog/article/content will be written based 
on the topic given by user. In the App, user needs to specify only Topic name, then they just need to click on 
the "Write Content" button.
